# Changelog

All notable changes to `@mmdx/studio` (named `mmdx` before 0.3.0). The project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); below 1.0, a minor version may change public API, listed under **Changed (breaking)**.

## Unreleased

### Changed (breaking)

- **Z-index is one style key, `z`, for every flowchart and ER item** (−99–99, higher draws over lower). The theme sets it per kind (base theme: groups `0`, connectors and relations `1`, nodes and tables `2`); an item, a preset or `style.<kind> _base` overrides it, and "From theme" in the toolbar removes the override. Connector labels now draw with their connector, so a label no longer shows over an unrelated node; give the connector a higher `z` to lift it. The toolbar's z-index control and ⌘[ / ⌘] change `z` instead of moving the statement in the Mermaid code (sequence diagrams keep the code order).

- **`<mmdx-studio>` keeps no diagram in the URL**: no `#d=…` in the address bar and no Share button; `persist` takes only `local`.
- **`encodeHash` and `decodeHash` are removed** from `@mmdx/studio` and `@mmdx/studio/adapters`.

## 0.3.0 — Hooks for sandboxed hosts

Hooks for hosts that embed mmdx in sandboxed iframes (no `allowfullscreen`, no `localStorage`, no fetches, no module workers from URLs).

### Added

- **Host full screen** for the viewer: a `fullscreen` property (`HostFullscreen`) and a cancelable `mmdx-fullscreen-request` event; `setControls()` changes the controls at run time.
- **`preloadedStorage(read, write)`**: a `StorageAdapter` over an async key-value store.
- **`registerThemes(files)`** and **`registerBuiltinThemes()`**: register bundled theme files without fetching.
- **`starterSource(type)`**: the starting source of a new flowchart, sequence or ER diagram.
- **`@mmdx/studio/worker-inline`**: `useInlineWorker()` starts the render worker from a `blob:` URL; `setWorkerUrl` takes the worker type.
- **Editor**: `setSource` passes `fit` and `markSaved` through (restore a draft as unsaved changes); `whenLoaded()` and the `mmdx-load` event.
- **Hide the light / dark toggle** and keep the theme menu: the editor's `schemeToggle` feature, the viewer's `scheme-toggle` attribute.
- **Documentation portal** at [udamir.github.io/mmdx](https://udamir.github.io/mmdx/), with the studio demo at `/studio/` and Storybook at `/storybook/`.

### Changed

- **The package is `@mmdx/studio`** (`mmdx` cannot be published). Entries keep their paths (`@mmdx/studio/viewer`, …); the root is the studio entry.

### Fixed

- Apps that bundle mmdx build: the library's asset URLs are relative.
- Emoji and Persian or Indic text keep their joiners (ZWJ, ZWNJ).
- Long runs of spaces no longer freeze the editor or the parser.
- A node named `__v0`, `__v1`… is laid out like any other node.
- Diff change badges sit beside the item instead of covering it.
- Side by side in the editor's History is drawn like the editor.

## 0.2.0 — History and diff

The editor and the viewer get a History of the diagram, `<mmdx-diff>` compares any two versions, and a DOM-free diff API serves CI bots. Every component shares the editor's chrome.

### Added

- **`<mmdx-diff>` and `DiagramDiff`**: Before, Merged, After and Side by side views of two versions, with change filters, Code, history, change list and Layers panels, review tools and exports (PNG, SVG, `.mmdx`, patch, Markdown or JSON report).
- **History in the editor and the viewer**: a `history` property adds a History button to view, compare and (in the editor) restore older versions; `mmdx-history-*` events and `historySession`.
- **History adapters**: `staticHistory(versions)` and `httpHistoryAdapter(url)`.
- **Core diff API** (`@mmdx/studio/core`): `diffDiagrams`, `renderDiffToSvg`, `diffReport`, `unifiedDiff` and more.
- **Studio**: document versions (Save version, ⌘S), Diff mode, example previews and example histories.
- **The theme menu everywhere**, the editor's chrome in the viewer, and `compact` and `features` attributes.
- The clipboard carries content between documents; elements keep their state when moved in the DOM.
- React wrapper `MmdxDiff`.

### Changed

- The editor's ⋯ menu is gone; hosts use the `openFiles` and `autoLayout` actions.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`canvas.theme` left the `.mmdx` format**: the theme comes from the component (`theme` / `theme-dark`, the user's pick, or the default pair).
- Theme and light / dark are independent.
- `EditorModule` is `ViewModule<EditorCore>` (`install(scope)`).
- Remembered preferences use per-component keys.
- `element.instance` is `null` while the element is not connected.
- An attribute applies one option; removing it restores the default.

### Upgrading from 0.1

- Set the theme on the element or through the `theme` option of `renderToSvg` and the markdown plugins.
- Rewrite custom editor modules as `{ id, install(scope) { const core = scope.core; … } }`.
- Check for `element.instance === null` instead of `undefined`.

## 0.1.0 — Mermaid Studio

First release: `<mmdx-viewer>`, `<mmdx-editor>`, `<mmdx-theme-editor>`, `<mmdx-studio>`, the `.mmdx` format, themes, `@mmdx/studio/core` with server-side rendering, Markdown plugins and React wrappers.
